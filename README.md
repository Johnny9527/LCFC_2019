# LCFC_2019

* I really enjoyed the time working in ASECL, but the internal political conflict made me feel uncomfortable. Therefore, when I received a call from the headhunter one day in the late January of 2019, asking me if I am interested in joining their company, I started to hesitate a bit. Later that night, I got a call from my ex-supervisor in Anselm. It turned out that my ex-supervisor was recruited by LCFC and he want to build a new PLM team. He invited me to join his team mainly because the great expertise of PLM systems that I showed back in the days in Anselm.

* Although my ex-supervisor had already knew that I will leave Taiwan and pursuing my Master's degree in the UK in August, he still persuaded me to join his team, helping him to import the PLM system.

* Eventually, I decided to join LCFC to import the PLM system, not only because I want to do a favor for my ex-supervisor, but also because I can strengthen my personal ability in taking new challenges.

* I was hired as a PLM Solution Engineer with a title of Supervisor Engineer to work in LCFC, which is the largest sub-cmpany of Lenovo. LCFC mainly in charge of designing and manufacturing laptops for Lenovo. [Reference Link: https://www.lcfuturecenter.com/ho/index.shtml]

* My personal responsibilities in LCFC was to organize and analyse internal users' requirements of Taipei, and also solved system's issues by configuring or developing customized functions. I was allocated in Taipei site, but LCFC's headquarter is located in Hefei China. Therefore, I needed to cooperate with the PLM team in Hefei remotely or even directly traveled to Hefei in order to deal with the problems.

* Although I only devoted myself in LCFC for three months, during my time working in LCFC, I well demonstrated my personal value by constructing PLM system with delivering several Solution Design Documents (SDDs), which are the documentations usually written by professional PLM consultants in order to tell the engineers how to develope the customized functions and also guide the users in how to use the system functions.
